Scripting:
- automating
- simplifying - simple scripts - point and click if need be
	shortcuts commands - to bash
Works fantastically for repetitive tasks

Watch for repetitive commands like starting a server - killing a server - do a shortcut	- make one click command
still to find some way to execute alias bash from windows shortcut like I  do with commands	

Examples:

Using notepad++:
- to record and play macros
- execute regular expressions that can do transformations from one format to another

Using bash scripting to find files and execute commands on them: archive them, build a report, delete them, append a header/footer, find a word in specific files

- git aliases that quickly add changed files, commit them and push them to remote if needed
- creating shortcuts/aliases for repetitive commands like:
- packaging and starting an appllication
- finding who is listening on a port
- stopping an application that is listening on a port

Good practice to have your own DomainSpecificCommands (DSC) that quickly do the steps required to be productive
