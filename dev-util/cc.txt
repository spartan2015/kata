stress:
take a pause
do some respiration breathing
do something that you enjoy deeply 

removed phone spam - through sms
removed phone spam - through mail sync
removed phone spam - not answering phone calls

total focus - remove any distrction - unecessary bookmars, news pages, desktop links, files, email -
ORGANIZE, HIDE, ARCHIVE, 
BRING INTO FOCUS THE VITAL FEW
organize your life around the vital few - put things in your way, make reminders
decision making fatigue: like what to order for lunch, what to snack between the meals - decide on a healthy one and stick to it, buy in bulk

remove noise - use ear plugs if necessary
beatiful work environemnt - beautiful energizing colors - white for concentration

clean environemnt - organized - simplified

After
relax and enjoy the process
nobody is expecting anything of you
it is ok to make bugs, relax
take breaks
get to know the team
learn to tools: IDE, etc.
learn the project
learn the process
really take time to learn
ask questions
be patient
know what you like - think long term (>10years) - start thinking now.
train for long term
your best bet is on what you like and you are gifted at - you will notice that straight away and there will be no doubt


Long Term
deeper dive into datastructures and algorithms
use tools like hackerrank
deeper dive into the language and framworks you currently use
you will never know everything and that is ok
be curios but know unused knowledge is useless. don't learn things just because they are hype
faculties and courses that waiste your time with courses that most probably you will never use
in practice you will use very few things from a faculty, and most of the time very different things than theory

design patterns
read code - practice your craft daily - your job may help you develop or it may not

learn on the job, on the problem - the best way it works - have a problem or task to solve - way better than going through all the project code aimlesly


[interview]
record interview, for later review and learning

go where you feel appreciated, needed, feel the energy of the environment and your future team
go where the enthusiasm, emotions are high, challenge is feels great

non standard
amazement of how different they are
not western style
focus on frameworks
waisting time with days and hours tests

a company that won't releveal the deal until the very last phase

even companies that will take 2-3 days of your life - for no good reason, don't pay more than the average

the economics of working for popular compnies - more work, less pay, more expectactions of you - obscure or startup usually pay better


the commute - matters - take 2 months per year out of your life spent on road

the myth that the test will reveal and you will be paid with skill...that is a myth

chasing "new" technologies

Log - Reflection

Productivity tools

Make dev life fun - eat together, fun cows, challengs - rankings

use public git repo - to share stuff

use cloud env - like cloud 9

have a plural sight subscription

read a relevant magazine for your field - JavaMagazine

Knowing when to leave the company:
do you feel safe?
do you feel you are learning and growing ?
do you feel stressed? - keep a journal - can you manage it ? what options do you realistically have
impact of emotional pain - so toxic - sooner is better
