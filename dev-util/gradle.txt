// Is this how to include individual test case? which option below is correct?

include ‘RunAllIntegrationTests.class’

//option 1

include ‘**/RunAllIntegrationTests.class’ //option 2

// Is this how to exclude all test cases under a specific directory?

exclude ‘com/abc/test/windowtester/**’

exclude ‘com/abc/def/myfolder/windowtester/**’

//Is this how to exclude a specific test case? which option below is correct?

exclude ‘TestAppLauncherAutoTest.class’

//option1

exclude ‘**/TestAppLauncherAutoTest.class’ //option2

}

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.


The test process can be started in debug mode (see Test.getDebug()) in an ad-hoc manner by supplying the `--debug-jvm` switch when invoking the build.
