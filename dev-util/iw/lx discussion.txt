pm discussion - 
generalities
contempt towards people
lying, hidding the truth
force and fear based
incompetent leader - project manager assi
late for meeting & unprepared when showed up - didn't even bother to read the resume... asked aaa I see you have some thing towards leadership... had no idea who he was talking to - arrogant, annoyed by questions about team members value. He was pissed at the end. I felt that.
Didn't check the camera -had none. I assumed he had technical problems...I was the only one on view.
- he didn't knew the people he was working with...why hire in that team if you don't - send someone who does
- seemed autistic, no emotion or care for the people, stakeholders... seemed like a machine, robot... that has no idea he is working with people.
- so no care for the person in front, contempt actually, arrogance and stupidity, of course had no idea how to motivate people, nothing mentioned about salary... or anything that would motivate me... spoke generalities about his work.
- at the end of the discussion I felt I was beeing coned into a softwared developer position and the lure was that some day a second team will form and I might be a team lead - TEPARI. ergo Reko Canada
- radical individual - doing a poor interviewing job - failing and then blaiming the candidate... not enough from candidate side...of course - no banking experience...pile of crap
- trying to diminish you...tell you you are not good enough for their extreme incompetence...

Recommendations:
- be on time if you can't be there early
- be totally prepared - read the cv twice, ask question relevant to the cv, quote from cv, show that you read and that you care and you appreciate that
- show that you value them, their time
- show clear vision about mission, objectives, how the person fits in it
- be truthful - instead of circleing or avoiding to answer the question - say, you know what, I really don't know. I am only here working 1 week. But that sounds like a good question. I will find out the answer and contact you later.
