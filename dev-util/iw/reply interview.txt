can't hear the passion - my resentment is killing the passion...
what do I need to learn to let the pain go - ELIMINATE IASI ALTOGETHER, Disconnect from all people there, reject all offers. Pain was raised solely as reminder of the damage those mafia did  to me. We are aware. We will stay away completly from Iasi and do plan to separta from Romania also with time and careful planning. what else do I need to let this go... feel safe disconnect... from them, even on my machine. We do good and moving to better.
There were indeed some unforgetable and unforgiveable things done there. So I guess what needs to be done to let this go is just leave Romania altogether ?
So reply is just for tech offer - nothing more - will not pursue this further. Just tech training and salary offer.
