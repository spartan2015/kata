Robin beliefes that before we were wounded, cultured, our nature is: full of creativity, massive potential, full of massive productivity, you are pure love and you can do things that are well beyond the scope of your current. Borned into mastery but cultured into mediocrity
Parents condition you. School condition you. Social pressure. TVand internet bullets of information - the world tells you what to think and do: inculturation.
Borned into greatness but the society pull the vail onto our eye and we are burried in their way of thinkin.
Know thyself-  know who you trully are, the fulness of power within you.
Make a difference between the world power in the orld: house, money, power
True power: there is a power within you that is so much more important, so much more real than worldy power: inner power
why more worldy power - something missing inside
a full well needs no more water
if your internal well is full because your are conencted with true nature, peach, joy, love, creativity, that is who is trully are you;'rere not going to need anything. You lack nothing. But you still can go for them, enjoy htme. Life is a beatiful experience that is worth pursuing.

Re: on this path to personal mastery and world class it is very easy tobe seduce into thinking ou are moving backwards when you are actually moving forward. The path to mastery is not lineary. Moving to next level requires you to move to new land, foreign land. You will feel confused and scared. It is a messy journey  to mastery. When you get to this place know that is part of your ascent to iconic. There are season. If you are tired rest. Your highest self knows what is best for you

- you seem to know the answers to life but other people don;t seemt to get . why ? Re: inculturation, hypnosis, people are asleep, consumers not producers. The point simply is this. As you ascent to world class people will think you're crazy. Any iconic player, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, . These see what most can't see.  You need reputation hardiness - you have to be strong in your dreams, character. When the world call you a loser, excentric. They try to bring you donw. Jeoulesy. You have to be aware of this as you go focused towards our dreams. More focused on your dreams, disconnect of people who bring you farther from your dreams.
