		<!-- The join table has two foreign key columns: SHIPMENT_ID, referencing the pri-
mary key of the SHIPMENT table; and ITEM_ID, referencing the ITEM table. The
ITEM_ID column is unique; a particular item can be assigned to exactly one ship-
ment. Because the primary key of the join table is SHIPMENT_ID, which makes this
column also unique, you have a guaranteed one-to-one multiplicity between
Shipment and Item.
