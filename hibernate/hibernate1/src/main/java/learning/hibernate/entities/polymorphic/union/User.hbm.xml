		If you want to enable the polymorphic union feature, a requirement for this poly-
morphic association is that itâ€™s inverse; there must be a mapping on the opposite
side. In the mapping of BillingDetails, with <union-subclass>, you have to
include a <many-to-one> association:
		
		 -->
		<set name="billingDetails" inverse="true">
			<key column="user_id" />
			<one-to-many class="BillingDetails" />
		</set>
		
		
	</class>
