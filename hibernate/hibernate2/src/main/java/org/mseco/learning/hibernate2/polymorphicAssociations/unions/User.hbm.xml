		<!--only ToMany associations you can have towards a Table Per Concrete Class With unions
		 because the fk must can not be from user towards the union tables (plural)
		
		If you want to enable the polymorphic union feature, a requirement for this poly-
morphic association is that itâ€™s inverse; there must be a mapping on the opposite
side. In the mapping of BillingDetails, with <union-subclass>, you have to
include a <many-to-one> association:
		- p 
		
		-->
		<set name="billingDetails" inverse="true"> <!-- it has to be inverse true - because BillingDetails table does not exist -->
			<key column="User_id" />
			<one-to-many class="BillingDetails" />
		</set>
		
	</class>
