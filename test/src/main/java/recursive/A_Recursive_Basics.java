/**
■ BASE CASE IF - The recursion has a base case—we always include a conditional statement as the
first statement in the program that has a return.

■ CONVERGENCE - SMALLER PROBLEMS DECOMPOSITION -  Recursive calls must address subproblems that are smaller in some sense, so
that recursive calls converge to the base case. In the code below, the difference
between the values of the fourth and the third arguments always decreases.
■ SUBPROBLEMS MUST NOT OVERLAP (leads to bad efficiency or incorrect solutions) Recursive calls should not address subproblems that overlap. In the code below,
the portions of the array referenced by the two subproblems are disjoint.
